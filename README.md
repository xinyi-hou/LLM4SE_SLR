# LLM4SE_SLR

This repository extends from our recent work, "[Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10620)". It includes necessary information for our research and a curated collection of LLM4SE papers and other resources (datasets, tutorials, etc.). The focus is primarily on papers that use Large Language Models (LLM) in Software Engineering (SE) research.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted numerous domains, including Software Engineering (SE). Many recent publications have explored LLMs applied to various SE tasks. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the application, effects, and possible limitations of LLMs on SE is still in its early stages. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on LLM4SE, with a particular focus on understanding how LLMs can be exploited to optimize processes and outcomes. We collect and analyze 395 research papers from 2017 to January 2024 \xy{The papers are collected until January 31, 2024, so maybe we should write ``to January 2024'' instead of ``to 2023'' or ``to 2024''.} to answer four key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we categorize different LLMs that have been employed in SE tasks, characterizing their distinctive features and uses. In RQ2, we analyze the methods used in data collection, preprocessing, and application, highlighting the role of well-curated datasets for successful LLM for SE implementation. RQ3 investigates the strategies employed to optimize and evaluate the performance of LLMs in SE. Finally, RQ4 examines the specific SE tasks where LLMs have shown success to date, illustrating their practical contributions to the field. From the answers to these RQs, we discuss the current state-of-the-art and trends, identifying gaps in existing research, and flagging promising areas for future study.
